# Video-Anomaly-SkipGAN
Video-Anomaly-SkipGAN is a theoretical replication of the Skip-GANomaly architecture for unsupervised video anomaly detection. The project focuses on translating the original paper’s concepts into a practical implementation, emphasizing architectural design and loss formulation rather than benchmark performance.
